Impact:


# Types:
#   feat:     new feature or enhancement
#   fix:      bug fix
#   docs:     documentation changes
#   test:     adding or updating tests
#   refactor: code restructuring without behavior change
#   chore:    maintenance tasks, deps, tooling
#
# Guidelines:
# - Use imperative mood ("add" not "added") in the headline
# - First line ~50-60 chars (clarity over brevity)
# - Wrap body at 72 characters
# - Focus on the value and reasoning
# - Consider the human + AI experience
