"""
Filesystem scope discovery for MCP servers.

Roots define what filesystem locations a server can access and operate on.
Servers use this information to understand their operating environment,
validate file operations, and tailor their offered capabilities to the
available scope.

## Discovery Flow

1. **Server asks** - "What filesystem locations can I access?" via ListRootsRequest
2. **Client responds** - Provides list of allowed directories and files
3. **Server adapts** - Configures capabilities based on available access
4. **Dynamic updates** - Client notifies server when access boundaries change

## Practical Usage

A code analysis server might discover it has access to `/home/user/projects`
and then offer tools for analyzing project structure, finding configuration
files, or searching codebasesâ€”all scoped to the available directories.

Roots help servers operate effectively within their allowed boundaries while
giving clients control over what filesystem locations are accessible.
